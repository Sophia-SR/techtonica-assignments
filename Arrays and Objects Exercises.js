// Week 3 - Arrays and Objects

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Make an empty array named animals
let animals = [];

// Exercise 2. Add the string "frog" to the array
animals.push("frog")
// Exercise 3. Add 4 more animals of your choice to the array. Try to add all of them in one line of code.
animals.push("snake", "fish", "dog", "giraffe"); 
console.log(animals);

// Exercise 4. Update the first item in the array to be "gorilla"
animals.unshift("gorilla");
console.log(animals);
// Exercise 5. Print the number of items in the array (use the array property that will give you this information)
console.log(animals.length);
// Exercise 6. Print the first item in the array
console.log(animals[0]); 
// Exercise 7. Print the last item in the array (as part of your answer, use the same array property you used in exercise 5 above)
console.log(animals[animals.length - 1])
// Exercise 8. Remove the last item from the array
console.log(animals.pop()); 
console.log(animals);
// Exercise 9. Now make a new array named assortedThings that contains at least 3 strings and 3 numbers.
let assortedThings = [2, 5, 12, "bips", "bops", "boops"];
// Exercise 10. Write a for loop that iterates through the assortedThings array and prints each index and item, such as:
for (i = 0; i < assortedThings.length; i++){
	console.log("Item #" + [i] + " is " + assortedThings[i] );
}
// Item #0 is potato
// Item #1 is 4
// Item #2 is Hello World
// 

// Exercise 11. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter. For each number in the array,
// print the number and "BIG" if it's over 100, "small" if it's between 0 and 100, and "negative" if
// it's less than 0. Example:
// if the array is [-2, 200, 50], print:
// -2 negative
// 200 BIG
// 50 small

function whichIsBigger(arr){
for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
	if (arr[i] < 0){
		console.log(arr[i] +" negative");
	}	else if (arr[i] < 100) {
		console.log(arr[i] + " small");
	}	else if (arr[i] > 100) {
		console.log(arr[i] +" BIG")
	}
	}
}
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.
whichIsBigger([-2, 4, 101, 7, 9]);
whichIsBigger([0, 7, 11, -45]);

// Exercise 12. Make an object called me that contains the following keys: name, favoriteAnimal, favoriteNumber
// The values of those keys can be whatever you choose.
let me = {
	name:"Sophia", 
	favoriteAnimal:"Ocelot",
 	favoriteNumber:"30"
};
// Exercise 13. Add another 2 keys and values to the object (you choose what they are)
me.favoriteFood = "Falafel";
me.secondFaveNumber = "7"

// Exercise 14. Update the favoriteAnimal value to something different
me.favoriteAnimal = "Red Panda";
// Exercise 15. Print the value of favoriteAnimal.
console.log(me.favoriteAnimal);
console.log(me["favoriteAnimal"]);
// Note: there are at least 2 ways to get the value of a key, try to write both.
